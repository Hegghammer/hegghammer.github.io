<p>Does poverty cause terrorism? Studies conducted in the years after 9/11 suggested not, because militant Islamists in the Middle East were often middle class. Subsequent research has indicated that radical Islamists in the West tend to come from lower strata of society, suggesting the dismissal of economic explanations for radicalization may have been premature. It could be, for example, that deprivation has different effects in different societies or economies.</p>
<p>To investigate this further, we mounted a multinational research project titled SOCIR &ndash; short for &ldquo;Socioeconomics of Islamist Radicalization in the West&rdquo;. The project brings together social scientists from the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI), the London School of Economics, and the Peace Research Institute in Oslo (PRIO). SOCIR is funded by the Research Council of Norway and will run from September 2020 to August 2024. The first of its kind, SOCIR will produce extensive new knowledge about the economic experiences of Western jihadists. The objective is to deepen our understanding of radicalization and contribute to the formulation of effective and inclusive prevention policies.</p>
<p>SOCIR will explore three main hypotheses about the link between deprivation and radicalization. First is the opportunity cost hypothesis: that poorer individuals are more likely to engage in militancy because they have less to lose. Second is the relative deprivation hypothesis: that people who perform less well than their qualifications suggest may be vulnerable to radicalization due to a sense of frustrated ambition. Third is the horizontal inequality hypothesis: that some people radicalize out of frustration with the collective deprivation of Muslims in their society, without being economically deprived themselves. We will explore these hypotheses with a combination of statistical analyses of biographical data, qualitative analysis of individual life trajectories, and interviews with former militants.</p>
